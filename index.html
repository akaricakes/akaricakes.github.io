                <h1>Accolades and Merits</h1>
                <p>Hey there! I'm Akari, a passionate Computer Science senior at CUNY Hunter College. I'm incredibly motivated and open to different subdivisions of the CS field. I've had prior experience in front and back-end programming, along with IT aid. Outside of CS, I've grown to adore data entry, and other organization-related tasks.</p>
